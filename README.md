# Talk: Where did my message goes? Distributed Tracing with OpenTracing

*Presented at NoSlidesConf 2017*

**Observability** is the ability to understand what is going on with your systems, not 
only from the point of view of how the system looks from outside, but been able to
answer more granular questions, like where did this message goes?

`Metrics`, `Logging` and `Tracing` are called the three pillars of Observability.

In this presentation we will see how we can use these tools and how they are related 
to be able to observe our systems.

## Logging and Metrics

Logging is the tool that we use to register events that occur on our systems.
